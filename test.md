| **Lyases**                | Break C–C or C–N bonds without hydrolysis or oxidation (often form double bonds). | Decarboxylases (e.g., pyruvate → acetaldehyde + CO₂ reaction).                                     |
| **Isomerases**            | Rearrange atoms within a molecule to form isomers (including optical isomers).    | Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase–type reactions (e.g., methylmalonyl-CoA ⇄ succinyl-CoA).                  |
| **Ligases (synthetases)** | Join two molecules using energy from ATP (ligation).                              | Enzymes in DNA replication (ligases) and pyruvate carboxylase (pyruvate → oxaloacetate using ATP). |

| **Nature**                   | Most enzymes are proteins (biological catalysts).                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Function**                 | Accelerate chemical reactions by lowering activation energy (do not change reaction equilibrium).                                                                                                  |
| **Specificity & regulation** | Each enzyme acts on specific substrates; activity regulated by cofactors, pH, temperature, inhibitors/activators, zymogen activation, transcriptional control, feedback and covalent modification. |
